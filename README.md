# This is my very first website!

Welcome :

This is my first GitHub project, made following the lectures on www.CodeInstitute.net
The website was made using HTML5 and CSS3.
It's a three page website that gives links to the programming languages / technologies used
in the three streams of the Code Institute's Fullstack Web Development course.
